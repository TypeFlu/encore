Encore Tweaks is a Magisk Module created to enhance device performance during gaming sessions, while keeping battery life optimized for normal use. With **fully automatic performance profiles** and **wide compatibility** across various SoCs, Encore Tweaks adapts dynamically to boost your device's performance when it matters most.

## Why Encore Tweaks?

### Automatic Performance Profiles
No need to manually adjust performance settings; Encore Tweaks automatically switches profiles based on app usage, allowing you to focus on what matters.

### Battery-Friendly Performance
Encore Tweaks only activates performance scripts during gaming sessions, preserving battery life for everyday use. Encore Tweaks also can cut your power consumption on battery saver mode.

### It Works Everywhere
Encore Tweaks are compatible with any Android device, no matter how weird it is. Supporting Snapdragon, MediaTek, Exynos, Google Tensor, Tegra, and even Unisoc, with custom optimizations tailored for each.

### Safe and Reliable
Zero brick or bootloop related incidents was reported from the beginning of release, Encore Tweaks also have been tested in multiple devices to ensure its reliability across different devices.

## How Encore Tweaks Works
Encore Tweaks works like a automated profiling system, it's dynamically adjusts your device's performance based on real-time data, such as the currently running app, screen state (awake or not), and battery saver mode. Using this information, it seamlessly switches between different profiles to optimize performance or save power as needed.

### Profiles Overview

#### Performance Profile
- **Activation**: Automatically enabled when an app or game listed in the **Gamelist** is launched and screen was awake.  
- **Purpose**: Ensures maximum responsiveness and stability during intensive tasks. Sets **CPU**, **GPU**, and **DRAM** frequencies to their highest frequency and prioritizes **CPU** and **I/O** resources for Game to minimize lag and jitter.

#### Powersave Profile
- **Activation**: Automatically enabled when the device is in **Battery Saver Mode** (except while charging).  
- **Purpose**: Maximizes power efficiency for extended battery life, limits non-essential component frequencies to their lowest frequency.

#### Normal Profile
- **Activation**: Applied when neither Performance nor Powersave conditions are met.  
- **Purpose**: Allows the device to operate under default system behavior without any special tweaks.
